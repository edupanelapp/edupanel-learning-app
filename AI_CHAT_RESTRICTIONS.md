# AI Chat Restrictions Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to restrict the Gemini AI chat functionality to students only and make it available only after login.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Components

#### `src/components/chat/StudentAIChatButton.tsx`
- New component that wraps the AI chat functionality with authentication and role checks
- Only renders if user is authenticated and has role 'student'
- Uses context from `AIChatContext` for dynamic subject and topic information

#### `src/components/chat/AIChatContext.tsx`
- Context provider to share AI chat context (subject and topic) across student pages
- Provides `setContext()` and `clearContext()` functions
- Default context: "General Studies" / "Learning Assistant"

### 2. Updated Layout Components

#### `src/components/layout/StudentLayout.tsx`
- Added `AIChatProvider` wrapper
- Added `StudentAIChatButton` component
- Now provides AI chat context to all student pages

### 3. Updated Student Pages

#### `src/pages/student/StudentDashboard.tsx`
- Added `useAIChatContext` hook
- Sets context to "Student Dashboard" / "General Academic Support"

#### `src/pages/student/StudentSubjectContent.tsx`
- Added `useAIChatContext` hook
- Sets context to subject name and "Subject Overview" when page loads
- Updates context to subject name and chapter title when chapter is selected

#### `src/pages/student/StudentUnitLearning.tsx`
- Added `useAIChatContext` hook
- Sets context to actual subject name and topic title when materials are loaded
- Added cleanup effect to clear context when component unmounts

### 4. Updated App.tsx

#### `src/App.tsx`
- Removed global `FloatingAIChatButton` import and usage
- AI chat button is now only available within student layout

## Security Features

### Authentication Check
- AI chat button only appears for authenticated users
- Uses `isAuthenticated` from `useAuth` hook

### Role-Based Access
- AI chat button only appears for users with role 'student'
- Faculty and HOD users cannot access the AI chat functionality
- Uses `user?.role !== 'student'` check

### Context Awareness
- AI chat provides context-aware responses based on current page
- Subject and topic information is dynamically updated
- Better educational assistance with relevant context

## Usage Flow

1. **Student Login**: User logs in as a student
2. **Context Setting**: Each student page sets appropriate AI chat context
3. **Button Display**: Floating AI chat button appears in bottom-right corner
4. **Context-Aware Chat**: AI responses are tailored to current subject/topic
5. **Context Cleanup**: Context is cleared when navigating away from pages

## Technical Implementation

### Context Flow
```
StudentLayout (AIChatProvider)
├── StudentDashboard (sets general context)
├── StudentSubjects (sets subject context)
├── StudentSubjectContent (sets subject/chapter context)
└── StudentUnitLearning (sets subject/topic context)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
useAuth hook → isAuthenticated check → user.role check → button render
```

### Context Management
```
Page loads → fetch subject/topic data → setContext() → AI chat aware
Page unmounts → clearContext() → reset to defaults
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Only authenticated students can access AI chat
2. **Relevance**: Context-aware responses improve learning experience
3. **Performance**: Context is managed efficiently with cleanup
4. **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing student workflow
5. **Scalability**: Easy to extend to other student pages

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Unauthenticated User**: AI chat button should not appear
2. **Faculty/HOD Login**: AI chat button should not appear
3. **Student Login**: AI chat button should appear
4. **Context Changes**: Navigate between student pages to see context updates
5. **Chat Functionality**: Test AI responses with different contexts

## Future Enhancements

- Add usage analytics for AI chat
- Implement rate limiting for AI requests
- Add more granular permissions (e.g., specific subjects)
- Integrate with learning progress tracking
- Add AI chat history persistence
